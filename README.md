Heal your pain and break free from your abusive relationship with this unique recovery program designed by one of the worldâ€™s leading authorities on narcissistic abuse

Narcissistic abuse was originally defined as a specific form of emotional abuse of children by narcissistic parents. More recently, the term has been applied more broadly, referring to any abuse by a narcissist (someone that who admires their own attributes)â€”especially adult-to-adult relationships, where the abuse may be mental, physical, financial, spiritual, or sexual.

Title: You can do this, I promise.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2018
Review: As an extremely successful and respected professional, I found myself in the middle of a relationship that I wanted to leave but did not understand why I could not find the strength to let go. I knew intellectually that this was wrong, it was not okay but it seemed like talking to people did not help me and when I was pressing charges for the physical abuse part, the ladies in the prosecutors office explained how strong I was, that this phenomenon of women going back to the abuser is just on repeat and no one understands. I felt this burning in my heart that God was telling me to speak and have a voice and stand up for this so I searched for anything that existed to help me stop this madness. I found Melanie. I bought her NARP program and began doing the modules that help you visualize the healing, and they work. This book is so simply made that anyone, even without any energy to do anything else and who feel like they may just want to give up can do. You can do this! And you can get results. When I started this program, I traveled often and found that professional women all over the United States are going through what you and I have and are dealing with. When I had a massage in Montana, the woman opened up and shared that her husband was abusive. A mother at the pool in DC asked me what I was listening to and when I told her she shared that her daughter was there with her because her husband would not permit her to have her parents at her home, could I talk to her. In Vegas a dealer explained all the women who are in there with these rich men who treat them sooooo poorly. The prosecutor's office. The OB-GYN. All of them I gave the Melanie Tonia Evans sites to give to women, and men, to get something that works! Every one of these people told me they found relief and understanding from this program. All got back to me without my asking, saying thank you for this. Most paid for the NARP program once they read and understood that this is what the "there has to be something to help me stop - or make this stop and let me live again" answer is. For me, I keep running into people who just open up about being abused and I keep telling them about Melanie. I want you to feel better, too. This Narcissism won't go away, but we can heal and protect ourselves from it. You can let go of feeling like you can't live without them and you an afford the life that you want. She will help.

Title: Valuable tool from an expert
Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2018
Review: MÃ©lanie Tonia Evans YouTube videos have been a vital tool in my discovery of the impact of the narcissists behavior on my family and myself.
She is clearly one of few experts and sharing her and others experiences is a gift.
Her book is a step by step way to understanding the narcissist (or as much as possible), to understand why we put ourselves in that position and how to acknowledge and Â« thrive Â» to our full potential .
She gave an significant amount of free material over the years in the form of all possible medias and this book shares it all in a form that you can always access when you need until you are back to life, and when experiencing narcissism is only a fairway memory. I would only recommend.

Title: This bookâ€™s Main goal is to advertise a program - priced at $297. Not cool. Iâ€™ve been punked.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2020
Review: This book has some useful information.
I give it 3 stars because youâ€™re not told that youâ€™re paying to be advertised to. Throughout the book, the author actively sells her program for narcissistic abuse recovery. What youâ€™re paying for is a lengthy advertisement for a recovery program priced at $297. You donâ€™t get back the money spent on the book if you choose to go with the program. At least then I wouldnâ€™t feel as manipulated. Not cool.

Title: Amazing!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2019
Review: I discovered Melanie Tonia Evans through her YouTube channel and watched her videos for months. I finally bought this book and joined her NARP program a few week ago. She is such a beautiful and brilliant soul. My life has changed drastically in the last couple of weeks and I feel ready to make the changes I need to in order to thrive, evolve, grow, and resonate with people and relationships that will benefit me instead of destroying me. If you have been emotionally, verbally, psychologically, or physically abused or if you have experienced narcissistic abuse or toxic and manipulative people then this book is for you. She has a lot of free videos on YouTube, a free program through her website, and I feel that she is genuine, real, and is invested in helping people survive and thrive after abuse. I highly recommend her book, her videos, the NARP program and her entire approach.

Title: Outstanding Book!!!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2018
Review: Melanie Tonia Evans has successfully created a safe, healing space for those people effected by Narcissistic Personality Disorder. The abuse that others are subjected to over time can cause a myriad of diseases and syndromes along with guilt, shame and anxiety. This topic has in recent times come to light and many people are healing. However, due to the nature of this confusing, covert and most times subtle issue, the types of healings are not always correct or helpful. Melanie Tonia Evansâ€™s book, YOU CAN THRIVE AFTER NARCISSTIC ABUSE, is the Bible on this topic to me! She teaches you to heal inner trauma so as to stop and end the reaction to the abuse. In other words, the victim concentrates on the parts of themselves that initially got them stuck in the quagmire of narcissistic abuse from the onset. In her book you learn why typical therapy modalities do not work on this type of abuse. I highly recommend this book FIRST before all others. Thank you, Melanie, for your courage, your kindness and empathy, your knowledge, experience and transparency, and especially thank you for being approachable to people! May the help and love you have given come back to you a thousand times! Thank you for a most outstanding book too!!
